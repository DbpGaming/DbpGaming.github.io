			<h2>Linux Distributions</h2>
			<a name="arch"><b>Arch Linux</b></a><p>
				Arch Linux is one of the most versatile linux distributions around. it doesn't have a graphical user
				enviroment by default, however
				it is easy to install one, and it being a barebones system allows you to customize it way beyond most
				other distros. not to mention,
				the AUR allows you to find basically anything you can dream of in terms of software. it has a more
				difficult learning curve, but is
				well rounded
			</p>
			<a name="artix"><b>Artix</b></a><p>
				Artix Linux is a fork of <a href="#arch">Arch</a> without systemd, all the same good shit, minus the bloatware that is
				systemd. it has openrc, runit,
				and s6 versions, it also has releases with desktop enviroments preinstalled, which is covered below
			</p>
			<a><b>Gentoo</b></a><p>
				Gentoo is another barebones and minimal linux distribution like Arch. it's designed around building as
				much of your software as possible
				from source, allowing for even more customization and efficency over distros like Arch, it also uses
				openrc as it's init system so you
				don't have to worry about systemd.
			</p>
		</section>

			<h2>Linux Distributions with a Desktop Enviroment</h2>
			<a name="endeavos"><b>EndeavorOS</b></a><p>
				EndeavorOS is a arch based linux distro with preinstalled desktop enviroments, xfce, lxqt, i3wm, etc, if
				you want arch but can't be bothered
				with installing the DE yourself this is for you.
			</p>
			<a name="artixgui"><b>Artix</b></a><p>
				<a href="#artix">Artix</a> has isos for a variety of different desktop enviroments, you can think of this exactly like
				<a href="#endeavos">EndeavorOS</a> with a Artix base and slightly
				different defaults.
			</p>
			<a><b>Xubuntu</b></a><p>
				Xubuntu is a ubuntu distribution with XFCE, i don't recommend ubuntu over security concerns and it's
				generally harder to use as a power user.
				but for people new to linux and maybe computers in general this is great, xfce has a mac like feel by
				default and is completely customizable,
				so you can probably make it work for anyone you need it to.
			</p>
			<a><b>Lubuntu</b></a><p>
				Lubuntu much like Xubuntu is a ubuntu distribution but with LXDE/LXQT, it's way more efficent than xfce
				as far as memory usage, lighter weight,
				and in general amazing for old computers, less customizable than the above though, so use when necessary
				only.
			</p>
			<a><b>Kubuntu</b></a><p>
				Kubuntu much like Xubuntu is a ubuntu distribution but with KDE, it's more modern and more memory efficient,
				than xfce, but by default is more intensive and bloated, and has UI consistency issues.
			</p>

			<h2>Non Linux Operating Systems</h2>
			<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/"><b>FreeBSD</b></a><p>
				FreeBSD is a posix/unix like operating system, much like Gnu/linux but is based on the berkely source
				distribution, it's generally way smaller than Linux and Gnu as far as development but it's powerful in it's
				own way, it uses openrc as it's init system, it's way closer to posix compliant than Gnu, and offers a
				variety of applications, a way better userland, plus you won't be screwed into using ALSA or pulseaudio.
				if you're a power user and Linux isn't enough for you, it's really worth a shot.
			</p>
			<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/"><b>OpenBSD</b></a><p>
				OpenBSD is a lot like FreeBSD but with more of a effort towards correct code, security on servers, and the
				Unix philosphy, it's extremely hard to get working on a desktop and drivers are lacking, but if it works go
				for it, it's atleast as good as FreeBSD in most cases
			</p>
			<a href="http://9front.org/"><b>9Front</b></a><p>
				9Front is a fork of <a href="#plan9">Plan9</a> with additional development including but not limited to more hardware
				support, nes/snes/gb/gbc/md emulators, the Constitution of the United States, The Manifesto of the Commmunist Party,
				and a whole lot more, just generally the updated version of Plan9, a lot of the dev's worked on the original aswell.
			</p>
			<a name="plan9"><b>Plan9</b></a><p>
				Plan9 is a Utilitarian operating system from the same group who created Unix, in a lot of ways it is essentially
				Unix2, it focuses on simplicity and reusablity like original Unix but pushes it into a graphical era.

			<h2>System Level Software</h2>
			<a><b>Dash</b></a><p>
				Dash - Debian Almquist SHell is the Debian port of ash, it's a super lightweight shell that's great for script
				execution, lacks many basic features for users, <a href="#linkdash">i highly recommend you link this to /bin/sh.</a>
			</p>
			<a name="doas"><b>Doas</b></a><p>
				Doas allows you to run a command as another user (ie Sudo), Doas is super lightweight compared to it's server
				oriented counterpart, great for single user pcs. Check out, <a href="#confdoas">Conf Doas</a> and
				<a href="#yaydoas">Yay with Doas</a>
			</p>
			<a><b>Mksh</b></a><p>
				Mksh - MirBSD Korn Shell, pretty much the most easy to find Korn Shell on linux, extremely lightweight
				and decently featured for a user shell, though is slower on execution time, recommend using it as your
				user shell with dash as /bin/sh, <a href="#changeyourshell">how to change your user shell.</a>
			</p>
			<a><b>Oksh</b></a><p>Oksh - OpenBSD Korn Shell, basically the same as the above but better in everyway use it when possible.</p>
			<a><b>Zsh</a></b><p>
				Zsh - Z Shell, is a really advanced User Shell with a ton of features, if you want something that can do
				everything this is it, it is extremely heavy on memory usage and could be considered bloated.
			</p>
			<a><b>Pacman</b></a><p>Pacman is the Arch Linux package manager, it's great, look at <a href="#confpacman">Conf Pacman</a></p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Configure Software</h3>
			<a name="linkdash"><b>Link Dash</b></a><p>
				<a href="#checkbinsh">Check your /bin/sh</a> if it says dash your set if not
				<a href="#checkshellsinstalled">check your installed shells</a>, if not install it with your package manager on Arch
				<code>pacman -S dash</code> once you have dash installed you can <a href="linkyourshell">link your shell</a>
			</p>
			<a name="checkbinsh"><b>Check your /bin/sh</b></a><p>
				To check if dash is linked to /bin/sh run <code>ls -l /bin/sh</code>
			</p>
			<a name="checkshellsinstalled"><b>Check what shells are Installed</b></a><p>
				Run <code>cat /etc/shells</code> to see what shells are installed
			</p>
			<a name="linkyourshell"><b>Link shell to /bin/sh</b></a><p>
				Use <code>ln -sf insertshellbinarynamehere /bin/sh</code> as root
			</p>
			<a name="changeyourshell"><b>Changing your User Shell</b></a><p>
				To change your user shell to whatever you want, find the shell on your system via <code>cat /etc/shells</code>
				and then set it with <code>usermod --shell /bin/mksh YOURUSERNAME</code> as an example.
			</p>
			<a name="confdoas"><b>Configure Doas</b></a><p>
				Put <code>permit persist keepenv YOURUSERNAME as root</code> in your doas.conf, if you want
				to know what everything does you can find information on the doas.conf online.
			</p>
			<a name="yaydoas"><b>Yay with Doas</b></a><p>
				To run <a href="#yay">Yay</a> with with <a href="#doas">Doas</a>, you need to make a shell alias,
				simply add <code>alias yay='yay --sudo doas'</code> to your .kshrc, .bashrc, .mkshrc, or .zshrc
			</p>
			<a name="confpacman"><b>Configure Pacman</b></a><p>
				You can add the <code>ParalellDownloads</code> option to your <code>/etc/pacman.conf</code> to allow parallel
				downloading, i recommend setting this to your processor threads, for example on my system i added.
				<code>ParalellDownloads = 6</code>
