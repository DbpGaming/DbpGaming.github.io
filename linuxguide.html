			<h2>Linux Distributions</h2>
			<a><b>Arch Linux</b></a>
			<p>
				Arch Linux is one of the most versatile linux distributions around. it doesn't have a graphical user
				enviroment by default, however
				it is easy to install one, and it being a barebones system allows you to customize it way beyond most
				other distros. not to mention,
				the AUR allows you to find basically anything you can dream of in terms of software. it has a more
				difficult learning curve, but is
				well rounded
			</p>
			<a><b>Artix Linux</b></a>
			<p>
				Artix Linux is a fork of Arch Linux without systemd, all the same good shit, minus the bloatware that is
				systemd. it has openrc, runit,
				and s6 versions, it also has releases with desktop enviroments preinstalled, which is covered below
			</p>
			<a><b>Gentoo</b></a>
			<p>
				Gentoo is another barebones and minimal linux distribution like arch. it's designed around building as
				much of your software as possible
				from source, allowing for even more customization and efficency over distros like Arch, it also uses
				openrc as it's init system so you
				don't have to worry about systemd.
			</p>

			<h2>Linux Distributions with a Desktop Enviroment</h2>
			<a><b>EndeavorOS</b></a>
			<p>
				EndeavorOS is a arch based linux distro with preinstalled desktop enviroments, xfce, lxqt, i3wm, etc, if
				you want arch but can't be bothered
				with installing the DE yourself this is for you.
			</p>
			<a><b>Artix</b></a>
			<p>
				Artix has isos for a variety of different desktop enviroments, you can think of this exactly like
				EndeavorOS with a artix base and slightly
				different defaults.
			</p>
			<a><b>Xubuntu</b></a>
			<p>
				Xubuntu is a ubuntu distribution with XFCE, i don't recommend ubuntu over security concerns and it's
				generally harder to use as a power user.
				but for people new to linux and maybe computers in general this is great, xfce has a mac like feel by
				default and is completely customizable,
				so you can probably make it work for anyone you need it to.
			</p>
			<a><b>Lubuntu</b></a>
			<p>
				Lubuntu much like Xubuntu is a ubuntu distribution but with LXDE/LXQT, it's way more efficent than xfce
				as far as memory usage, lighter weight,
				and in general amazing for old computers, less customizable than the above though, so use when necessary
				only.

			<h2>Non Linux Operating Systems</h2>
			<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/"><b>FreeBSD</b></a>
			<p>
				FreeBSD is a posix/unix like operating system, much like Gnu/linux but is based on the berkely source
				distribution, it's generally way smaller than Linux and Gnu as far as development but it's powerful in it's
				own way, it uses openrc as it's init system, it's way closer to posix compliant than Gnu, and offers a
				variety of applications, a way better userland, plus you won't be screwed into using ALSA or pulseaudio.
				if you're a power user and Linux isn't enough for you, it's really worth a shot.
			</p>
			<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/"><b>OpenBSD</b></a>
			<p>
				OpenBSD is a lot like FreeBSD but with more of a effort towards correct code, security on servers, and the
				Unix philosphy, it's extremely hard to get working on a desktop and drivers are lacking, but if it works go
				for it, it's atleast as good as FreeBSD in most cases
			</p>
			<a href="http://9front.org/"><b>9Front</b></a>
			<p>
				9Front is a fork of Plan9(see below) with additional development including but not limited to more hardware
				support, nes/snes/gb/gbc/md emulators and a whole lot more, just generally the updated version of Plan9.
			</p>
			<a><b>Plan9</b></a>
			<p>
				Plan9 is a Utilitarian operating system from the same group who created Unix, in a lot of ways it is essentially
				Unix2, it focuses on simplicity and reusablity like original Unix but pushes it into a graphical era.
