			<h2>Manga</h2><p>
				Note Vol means how far i read, if theres no volume number it means
				i've completed it or its not done in volumes.
			</p>

			<a>Dragon Ball</a><p>
				a fantasy martial arts, adventure, sci fi, manga that ran for over 500 chapters,
				created by akira toriyama dragon ball goes from strong kids exploring the earth,
				to battles on a galactic scale, with actual emotional story telling, and
				simplestic but honest desires and philosphies you can probably learn more from
				this manga any school.
			</p>

			<a>FullMetal Alchemist (Vol 16/27)</a><p>
				takes it self seriously in way other mangas can't, honestly probably one of the best,
				over the emotion moments, the manga basically  has everything good about both animes and more,
				without the bad, its the definitive way to consume FMA.
			</p>

			<a>One Piece (Vol 13)</a><p>
				good shonen, really well paced for how long it is, and has good writing.
			</p>

			<a>Dragon Ball Super (Ch 78)</a><p>
				Great manga, continuation to the original dragon ball and minus toriyama's,
				lack of understanding of his own time travel system, is really thought out,
				and fleshed out, other than plot points entirely different than the anime,
				and a hundred times better.
			</p>

			<a>Dragon Ball Multiverse</a><p>
				fan contiunation to the original dragonball, great manga, not as good as super
				but has clever usage of characters and their powers going for it.
			</p>

			<a>Domestic Girlfriend (Vol 1)</a><p>
				TODO: read more.
			</p>

			<a>Konosuba (Vol 11)</a><p>
				Konosuba is great ton of great jokes and general a lighthearted, but not unserious story,
				also some of the better written characters in manga.
			</p>

			<a>One Piece (Vol 18)</a><p>
				pirate adventure manga, good writing and philosphies, insanely well written inspirational, and honestly
				really intelligent, fantastic. based as hell.
			</p>

			<a>Zelda "Legendary Edition" Manga</a><p>
				the legendary editon zelda mangas are great, they are all retelling of the games stories,
				within margin of error for story telling, some changes to fit the format, really helps
				flesh out the games and is definitely not a boring read.
			</p>
