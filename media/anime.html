		<h2>Top of the lists are the highest rating.</h2>
		<h1>ALWAYS WATCHED SUBBED NEVER DUBBED ONLY VILLANS WATCH DUBBED.</h1>

		<section>
			<h2>Anime</h2><p>EP/S means how far i've watched, none means completed.</p>
			<a>Sakurasou</a><p>
				i don't know how to explain this anime other than,
				a ultimate inspirational slice of life.
			</p>

			<a>Neon Genesis Evangelon</a><p>
				cool "mech battle" anime, that slowly morphs into one of the most inspirational animes possible,
				honestly it's absolutely amazing 10/10
			</p>

			<a>Dragon Ball</a><p>
				The anime adaptation of Akira Toriyama's dragon ball is great, it takes everything about the manga,
				and adapts it perfectly into the anime format, while providing reasonable filler, that only serves
				to flesh out the world instead of waste your time.
			</p>

			<a>Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)</a><p>
				FMA03 faithfully adapts the original manga until a certain point, it entirely changes the ending,
				as the anime was finished way before the manga, but overall its great, watch it before brotherhood,
				if you're watching both animes as brotherhood ruins certain points of the story that are best spoiler
				free, i recommend reading the manga however, its way better.
			</p>

			<a>Domekano</a><p>
				Seems to be a decent adaption of the manga(note to expand on this once i read the manga and add that entry)
				really great story honestly, great romance drama, but you can sort of tell the story isn't over,
				will expand upon if there is another season.
			</p>

			<a>Saekano</a><p>
				season 1 is great, season 2 is meh, anime about vn creation basically,.
			</p>

			<a>Oregairu (S 2/3)</a><p>
				great anime, inspirtation to many, don't really have that much to say.
			</p>

			<a>Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai! (EP 5/12</a><p>
				funny rom-com anime, probably some of the best animation, and jokes of modern anime.
			</p>

			<a>Dragon Ball GT</a><p>
				DBGT is a continuation of dragon ball (z if anime) by the anime team, it tries to be more akin to
				dragon balls roots instead of what it ended up being late game, ultimately ending with a mix of the
				styles, and its definitely is a must see
			</p>

			<h2>Bad Anime</h2><p>
				bad anime is a section for anime i still want to list, but not necessarily
				recommend, it doesn't mean their bad, but in most cases theres a better form
				of the media, like a manga or visual novel.
			</p>

			<a>Grisaia</a><p>
				i had a hard time putting this here because i love grisaia, but the anime
				makes it hard to process because of the story compression and speed,
				it's a good watch if you've read the VNs but i'd never recomend watching it
				first.
			</p>

			<a>Island</a><p>
				same issues as the grisaia animes but even more chopped up and implementing
				foreshadowing that outright spoils the later parts.
			</p>

			<a>Dragon Ball Z</a><p>
				okay time to piss a lot of people off, dragon ball z should be considered
				probably the worst manga to anime adaption of all time, the filler is everywhere,
				theres a ton of inconsistencies created by it, all of its boring, and you can tell
				the story was streched to stay behind the manga, there is actual good bits put in,
				to fix issues the manga had, but theres just too much nonsensical garbage to make
				it worth it, read the manga, if you have to watch it, skip the garlic jr arc,
				and use 2-3x speed on fights like the freeza fight.
			</p>

			<a>Dragon Ball Super</a><p>
				continuation of dragon ball in anime form, this does not adapt the manga,
				toriyama writes notes and then toyotaro and toei fill in the blanks in different
				ways, many plot issues created by toei, plus the toriyama ones, plus some filler
				thats outright boring, honestly if you watch, watch the DBS movies and skip,
				the anime adaptions of the beerus and freeza arcs.
			</p>

			<a>Key VNs (Air, Clannad, Kanon)</a><p>
				sort of the same issues as grisaia and island but less extreme, the route mergals,
				really kills them in a way, read the VNs first.
			</p>
