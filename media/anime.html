			<h2>ALWAYS WATCHED SUBBED NEVER DUBBED ONLY VILLANS WATCH DUBBED.</h2>
			<h2>Top of the lists are the highest rating.</h2>

			<h2>Anime</h2><p>EP/S means how far i've watched, none means completed.</p>
			<a>Sakurasou</a><p>
				i don't know how to explain this anime other than,
				a ultimate inspirational slice of life.
			</p>

			<a>Neon Genesis Evangelon</a><p>
				cool "mech battle" anime, that slowly morphs into one of the most inspirational animes possible,
				honestly it's absolutely amazing 10/10
			</p>

			<a>Dragon Ball</a><p>
				The anime adaptation of Akira Toriyama's dragon ball is great, it takes everything about the manga,
				and adapts it perfectly into the anime format, while providing reasonable filler, that only serves
				to flesh out the world instead of waste your time.
			</p>

			<a>Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)</a><p>
				FMA03 faithfully adapts the original manga until a certain point, it entirely changes the ending,
				as the anime was finished way before the manga, but overall its great, watch it before brotherhood,
				if you're watching both animes as brotherhood ruins certain points of the story that are best spoiler
				free, i recommend reading the manga however, its way better.
			</p>

			<a>Domekano</a><p>
				Seems to be a decent adaption of the manga(note to expand on this once i read the manga and add that entry)
				really great story honestly, great romance drama, but you can sort of tell the story isn't over,
				will expand upon if there is another season.
			</p>

			<a>Saekano</a><p>
				season 1 is great, season 2 is meh, anime about vn creation basically,.
			</p>

			<a>Oregairu (S 2/3)</a><p>
				great anime, inspirtation to many, don't really have that much to say.
			</p>

			<a>love an lies</a><p>
				arranged marriage based rom-com anime, based and great.
			</p>

			<a>Uzaki-chan wa Asobitai!</a><p>
				funny rom-com anime, probably some of the best animation, and jokes of modern anime.
			</p>

			<a>Dragon Ball GT</a><p>
				DBGT is a continuation of dragon ball (z if anime) by the anime team, it tries to be more akin to
				dragon balls roots instead of what it ended up being late game, ultimately ending with a mix of the
				styles, and its definitely is a must see
			</p>

			<h2>Bad Anime</h2><p>
				bad anime is a section for anime i still want to list, but not necessarily
				recommend, it doesn't mean their bad, but in most cases theres a better form
				of the media, like a manga or visual novel.
