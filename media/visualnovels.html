			<h2>Visual Novels</h2><p>
				R(routes) is a measure of completion sadly it isn't as explainatory as vols or eps.
			</p>

			<a>Island</a><p>
				a really complicated VN about someone who washes up on an <i>inhabited</i> island,
				honestly great story that i don't really know how to praise without spoiling.
			</p>

			<a>The Fruit of Grisaia</a><p>
				a 130hour vn about the protagonist Kazami Yuuji going to a very special highschool,
				there are 5 heroines with 5 routes and 2 endings per route, the game has backstories
				for all the heroines and is extremely well written, this is another thing you can
				really learn a lot from.
			</p>

			<a>The Labyrinth of Grisaia</a><p>
				the backstory of Kazami Yuuji and afterstories for the routes in The Fruit of Grisaia,
				would recommend just as much
			</p>

			<a>The Eden of Grisaia</a><p>
				a story that ties together the plot threads of the previous Grisaia games,
				exists in a timeline where all the routes basically happened, can't recommend more.
			</p>

			<a>Grisaia Side Games (Leisure, Afterglow, Melody</a><p>
				short 1 hour vns, all great, but ultimately not much.
			</p>

			<a>Atri My Dear Moments</a><p>
				7-8 hour vn about a world with androids and where most of the world has sunken,
				inspiring and also really technical.
			</p>

			<a>Kanon</a><p>
				classic VN not much for me to say about it as its less unique since people,
				have copied key's style, if you like clannad you'll like it.
			</p>

			<a>Clannad</a><p>
				probably the most known VN of all times, some of the best writing, emotional highs,
				though. still a bit generic.
			</p>

			<a>Tomoyo After</a><p>
				essentially an extension to clannad, a afterstory for tomoyo with different ends.
			</p>

			<a>Air</a><p>
				Weakest of the key vns but not bad at all.
			</p>
