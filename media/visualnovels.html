			<h2>Visual Novels</h2><p>
				hr is how long it took me to complete it.
			</p>

			<span>A Sky Full of Stars (40r)</span><p>
				a really well written an emotional vn, really good character relationships and stories,
				technical as fuck as vns should be and will make you cry,
				probably the one id recommend the most on this list,
				amazing music as well, it's essentially a one up to IMMHW.
				though one route has some fanficy issues, which may be part poor translation.
				doesn't matter better than anything else still.
				i highly recommend reading hikaris route last.
			</p>

			<span>If My Heart Had Wings (30hr)</span><p>
				<b>INSTALL THE RETRANSLATION PATCH</b>
				a vn about creating a glider, actually decently technical,
				it's has some good emotional moments super inteligent writing,
				you will probably cry and you really will have fun,
				and was the first VN i read very good.
			</p>

			<span>Adventure of a Lifetime (7hr)</span><p>
				tiny all ages VN, great story as usual from pulltop.
			</p>

			<span>Island (21hr)</span><p>
				a really complicated VN about someone who washes up on an <i>inhabited</i> island,
				honestly great story that i don't really know how to praise without spoiling.
			</p>

			<span>Atri My Dear Moments (7hr)</span><p>
				a vn about a world with androids and where most of the world has sunken,
				inspiring and also really technical.
			</p>

			<span>The Fruit of Grisaia (130hr)</span><p>
				a vn about the protagonist Kazami Yuuji going to a very special highschool,
				there are 5 heroines with 5 routes and 2 endings per route, the game has backstories
				for all the heroines and is extremely well written, this is another thing you can
				really learn a lot from.
				<!-- LIBGL_DRI3_DISABLE=1 LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 PROTON_NO_ESYNC=1 -->
			</p>

			<span>The Labyrinth of Grisaia (24hr)</span><p>
				the backstory of Kazami Yuuji and afterstories for the routes in The Fruit of Grisaia,
				would recommend just as much
			</p>

			<span>The Eden of Grisaia</span><p>
				a story that ties together the plot threads of the previous Grisaia games,
				exists in a timeline where all the routes basically happened, can't recommend more.
			</p>

			<span>Grisaia Side Games (Leisure, Afterglow, Melody | 1hr each)</span><p>
				all great, but ultimately not much.
			</p>

			<span>Yukikoi Melt (30hr)</span><p>
				another frontwing VN, nothing really unique about this one honestly,
				not to say that its bad its just generic, its frontwing other than phantom trigger
				they release good products.
			</p>

			<span>Riddle Joker (70hr)</span><p>
				great VN about people with special ablities, all the routes are fairly unique and well written
			</p>

			<span>Sabbat of the Witch (60hr)</span><p>
				larger VN about witches, first yuzuge i played, and it's great.
			</p>

			<span>Senren Banka (65hr)</span><p>
				a VN about kicking ass and taking names against evil spirits.
			</p>

			<span>Chrono Clock(50hr)</span><p>
				if you could go back in time 5 minutes what would you do.
			</p>

			<span>Hapymaher(75hr)</span><p>
				happy nightmares, purpleges are always good.
			</p>

			<span>Kanon (40hr)</span><p>
				classic VN not much for me to say about it as its less unique since people,
				have copied key's style, if you like clannad you'll like it.
			</p>

			<span>Clannad (90hr)</span><p>
				probably the most known VN of all times, some of the best writing, emotional highs,
				though. still a bit generic.
			</p>

			<span>Tomoyo After (15hr)</span><p>
				essentially an extension to clannad, a afterstory for tomoyo with different ends.
			</p>

			<span>Air (70hr)</span><p>
				Weakest of the key vns but not bad at all.
			</p>

			<span>Fureraba Friend to Lover (24hr)</span><p>
				vn about being a chad. but no seriously good dating sim with good writing.
			</p>

			<span>Sugar Style (r4)</span><p>
				putting the comedy into romantic comedy, i don't know how to explain it but this VN just makes me smile.
			</p>
