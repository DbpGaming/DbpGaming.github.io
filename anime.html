		<h1>ALWAYS WATCHED SUBBED NEVER DUBBED ONLY VILLANS WATCH DUBBED.</h1>

		<section>
			<h2>Anime</h2><p>EP/S means how far i've watched, none means completed.</p>
			<a>Sakurasou</a><p>
				i don't know how to explain this anime other than,
				a ultimate inspirational slice of life.
			</p>

			<a>Neon Genesis Evangelon</a><p>
				cool "mech battle" anime, that slowly morphs into one of the most inspirational animes possible,
				honestly it's absolutely amazing 10/10
			</p>

			<a>Dragon Ball</a><p>
				The anime adaptation of Akira Toriyama's dragon ball is great, it takes everything about the manga,
				and adapts it perfectly into the anime format, while providing reasonable filler, that only serves
				to flesh out the world instead of waste your time.
			</p>

			<a>Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)</a><p>
				FMA03 faithfully adapts the original manga until a certain point, it entirely changes the ending,
				as the anime was finished way before the manga, but overall its great, watch it before brotherhood,
				if you're watching both animes as brotherhood ruins certain points of the story that are best spoiler
				free, i recommend watching FMA03 and then reading the manga.
			</p>

			<a>Domekano</a><p>
				Seems to be a decent adaption of the manga(note to expand on this once i read the manga and add that entry)
				really great story honestly, great romance drama, but you can sort of tell the story isn't over,
				will expand upon if there is another season.
			</p>

			<a>Saekano</a><p>
				season 1 is great, season 2 is meh, anime about vn creation basically,.
			</p>

			<a>Oregairu (S 2/3)</a><p>
				great anime, inspirtation to many, don't really have that much to say.
			</p>

			<a>Dragon Ball GT</a><p>
				DBGT is a continuation of dragon ball (z if anime) by the anime team, it tries to be more akin to
				dragon balls roots instead of what it ended up being late game, ultimately ending with a mix of the
				styles, and its definitely is a must see
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Bad Anime</h2><p>
				bad anime is a section for anime i still want to list, but not necessarily
				recommend, it doesn't mean their bad, but in most cases theres a better form
				of the media, like a manga or visual novel.
			</p>

			<a>Grisaia</a><p>
				i had a hard time putting this here because i love grisaia, but the anime
				makes it hard to process because of the story compression and speed,
				it's a good watch if you've read the VNs but i'd never recomend watching it
				first.
			</p>

			<a>Island</a><p>
				same issues as the grisaia animes but even more chopped up and implementing
				foreshadowing that outright spoils the later parts.
			</p>

			<a>Dragon Ball Z</a><p>
				okay time to piss a lot of people off, dragon ball z should be considered
				probably the worst manga to anime adaption of all time, the filler is everywhere,
				theres a ton of inconsistencies created by it, all of its boring, and you can tell
				the story was streched to stay behind the manga, there is actual good bits put in,
				to fix issues the manga had, but theres just too much nonsensical garbage to make
				it worth it, read the manga, if you have to watch it, skip the garlic jr arc,
				and use 2-3x speed on fights like the freeza fight.
			</p>

			<a>Dragon Ball Super</a><p>
				continuation of dragon ball in anime form, this does not adapt the manga,
				toriyama writes notes and then toyotaro and toei fill in the blanks in different
				ways, many plot issues created by toei, plus the toriyama ones, plus some filler
				thats outright boring, honestly if you watch, watch the DBS movies and skip,
				the anime adaptions of the beerus and freeza arcs.
			</p>

			<a>Key VNs (Air, Clannad, Kanon)</a><p>
				sort of the same issues as grisaia and island but less extreme, the route mergals,
				really kills them in a way, read the VNs first.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Manga</h2><p>
				Note Vol means how far i read, if theres no volume number it means
				i've completed it or its not done in volumes.
			</p>

			<a>Dragon Ball</a><p>
				a fantasy martial arts, adventure, sci fi, manga that ran for over 500 chapters,
				created by akira toriyama dragon ball goes from strong kids exploring the earth,
				to battles on a galactic scale, with actual emotional story telling, and
				simplestic but honest desires and philosphies you can probably learn more from
				this manga any school.
			</p>

			<a>FullMetal Alchemist (Vol 12/27)</a><p>
				takes it self seriously in way other mangas can't, honestly probably one of the best,
				over the emotion moments, the manga basically  has everything good about both animes,
				without the bad, its the definitive way to consume FMA.
			</p>

			<a>Dragon Ball Super (Vol 13)</a><p>
				Great manga, continuation to the original dragon ball and minus toriyama's,
				lack of understanding of his own time travel system, is really thought out,
				and fleshed out, other than plot points entirely different than the anime,
				and a hundred times better.
			</p>

			<a>Dragon Ball Multiverse</a><p>
				fan contiunation to the original dragonball, great manga, not as good as super
				but has clever usage of characters and their powers going for it.
			</p>

			<a>Domestic Girlfriend (Vol 1)</a><p>
				TODO: read more.
			</p>

			<a>Konosuba (Vol 10)</a><p>
				Konosuba is great ton of great jokes and general a lighthearted, but not unserious story,
				also some of the better written characters in manga.
			</p>

			<a>One Piece (Vol 8)</a><p>
				pirate adventure manga, good writing and philosphies, fantastic.
			</p>

			<a>Zelda "Legendary Edition" Manga</a><p>
				the legendary editon zelda mangas are great, they are all retelling of the games stories,
				within margin of error for story telling, some changes to fit the format, really helps
				flesh out the games and is definitely not a boring read.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Visual Novels</h2><p>
				R(routes) is a measure of completion sadly it isn't as explainatory as vols or eps.
			</p>

			<a>Island</a><p>
				a really complicated VN about someone who washes up on an <i>inhabited</i> island,
				honestly great story that i don't really know how to praise without spoiling.
			</p>

			<a>The Fruit of Grisaia</a><p>
				a 130hour vn about the protagonist Kazami Yuuji going to a very special highschool,
				there are 5 heroines with 5 routes and 2 endings per route, the game has backstories
				for all the heroines and is extremely well written, this is another thing you can
				really learn a lot from.
			</p>

			<a>The Labyrinth of Grisaia</a><p>
				the backstory of Kazami Yuuji and afterstories for the routes in The Fruit of Grisaia,
				would recommend just as much
			</p>

			<a>The Eden of Grisaia</a><p>
				a story that ties together the plot threads of the previous Grisaia games,
				exists in a timeline where all the routes basically happened, can't recommend more.
			</p>

			<a>Grisaia Side Games (Leisure, Afterglow, Melody</a><p>
				short 1 hour vns, all great, but ultimately not much.
			</p>

			<a>Atri My Dear Moments</a><p>
				7-8 hour vn about a world with androids and where most of the world has sunken,
				inspiring and also really technical.
			</p>

			<a>Kanon</a><p>
				classic VN not much for me to say about it as its less unique since people,
				have copied key's style, if you like clannad you'll like it.
			</p>

			<a>Clannad</a><p>
				probably the most known VN of all times, some of the best writing, emotional highs,
				though. still a bit generic.
			</p>

			<a>Tomoyo After</a><p>
				essentially an extension to clannad, a afterstory for tomoyo with different ends.
			</p>

			<a>Air</a><p>
				Weakest of the key vns but not bad at all.
			</p>
