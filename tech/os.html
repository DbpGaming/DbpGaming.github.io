			<h2>Simple. Correct. Extensible. And Choice Driven</h2>
			<p>Write up on how i think operating systems should be designed, sort of tired of the current systems we have.</p>

			<p>Simple. a operating system should be simple, a low line count auditable codebase, but also low memory usage.</p>

			<p>Correct. do it right, or not at all, do not half ass implement bluetooth drivers to drive the userbase up.</p>

			<p>Extensible. every part of the OS should be a tool that can be used in conjunction with others.</p>

			<p>Choice Driven. the operating system should be respectful of the users choice, and everything should be changible by an adept user.</p>

			<h2>Software that could be used for this</h2>

			<a href="https://www.musl-libc.org/">Musl</a><p>
				Provides a simple libc that can be statically linked.
			</p>

			<a>Toybox</a><p>
				Provides simple and efficient core utils, would probably be best to fork and add plan9 features as well as strip unneeded gnu features.
			</p>

			<a>runit</a><p>
				super simple and fast init system.
			</p>

			<h2>Software that is still needed for this</h2>

			<a>Execute command as another user</a><p>
				doas is probably okay, id rather implement a alternative in the Toybox fork however.
			</p>

			<a>C Compiler</a><p>
				we possibly could use SCC, or 8CC it needs to be looked into.
			</p>

			<a>Shell</a><p>
				pdksh is an option but is not efficient enough imo, if busybox ash was standalone it would be perfect, maybe we can fix up Toybox sh.
			</p>

			<a>Kernel</a><p>
				Linux and openbsd aren't microkernels and besides linux seems a bit too bloated, minix is outdated, gnu mach seems doesn't seem ready.
			</p>

			<a>Package Manager</a><p>
				a simple source based package manager would be nice, portage seems bloated.
			</p>
