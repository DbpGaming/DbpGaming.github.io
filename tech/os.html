			<h2>simple. secure. correct. libre. modular. extensible. lightweight. and user-choice driven.</h2>

			<p>Write up on how i think operating systems should be designed, sort of tired of the current systems we have.</p>

			<p>
				first a operating system would need to be light weight, 64mb of ram should run the operating system in a terminal only state,
				and even then that's a bit much.
			</p>

			<p>a operating system would need to be correct, i'm refering to openbsd like correctness, do everything the right way.</p>

			<p>the kernel should be either a hybrid or microkernel, this is just modern shit.</p>

			<p>drivers should mainly be one monolithic open source package maintained by the community.</p>

			<p>
				the operating system should have a set spec, and replacing the binaries within that spec being perfectly acceptable,
				think the posix spec but more sane and enforced
			</p>

			<p>
				the operating system should use source based package management allowing software to be build for a specific system,
				and to be easily patched.
			</p>

			<p>it should allow you to link statically or dynamically depending on your choice, and compile everything with whatever options you desire.</p>

			<p>everything should be a file</p>

			<p>follow the unix philosphy to a t.</p>

			<p><a>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better</a></p>

			<p>plan9 is the successor to unix.</p>

			<p>never repeat yourself.</p>

			<p>modern file system.</p>

			<p>
				the operating system should never choose for you, always give the user the choice, do not install a default shell or core utils let the user
				pick their own.
			</p>

			<p>a adept computer user should be able to entirely understand their OS and change <italic>anything</italic></p>

			<p>test driven development is a must.</p>

			<p>packages should not be monolithic, have groups with subpackages for everything, looking at you gnu core utils.</p>

			<p>any security migations should be taken, such as relinking the system software every shutdown.</p>

			<p>tty's should be a first class citizen, in fact it should be the assumed default state.</p>

			<p>everything should be as self contained as much as possible.</p>

			<p>
				the "stacking effect" is important, you should learn how to use programs and functions together,
				even in ways that were never considered, vi and unix philosphy to the max.
			</p>

			<p>a text editor should edit text.</p>

			<p>think different.</p>

			<p><a>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle</a></p>

			<p>an os should be as fast as possible within the other provided bounds.</p>

			<p>embed devices should be a first class citizen not an afterthought.</p>

			<p>the operating system should be fun.</p>
