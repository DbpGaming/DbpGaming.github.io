			<h2>Posix Operating Systems</h2>
			<a name="alpine">Alpine Linux</a><p>
				A lot like arch linux, uses busybox, musl, and openrc by default extremely lightweight great for low resource machines.
				also has a installer a lot like openbsds, really a great mix between arch and openbsd.
			</p>
			<a name="OpenBSD" href="https://www.openbsd.org/"><b2>OpenBSD</b2></a><p>
				A lot like FreeBSD but with more of a effort towards correct code, security on servers, and the
				Unix philosphy, it's extremely hard to get working on a desktop and drivers are lacking, but if it works go
				for it, it's atleast as good as FreeBSD in most cases
			</p>
			<a name="FreeBSD" href="https://www.freebsd.org/"><b2>FreeBSD</b2></a><p>
				A posix/unix like operating system, much like Gnu/linux but is based on the berkely source
				distribution, it's generally way smaller than Linux and Gnu as far as development but it's powerful in it's
				own way, it uses openrc as it's init system, it's way closer to posix compliant than Gnu, and offers a
				variety of applications, a way better userland, plus you won't be screwed into using ALSA or pulseaudio.
				if you're a power user and Linux isn't enough for you, it's really worth a shot.
			<a name="arch">Arch Linux</a><p>
				One of the most versatile linux distributions around. it doesn't have a graphical user
				enviroment by default, however it is easy to install one,
				and it being a barebones system allows you to customize it way beyond most other distros.
				not to mention, the AUR allows you to find basically anything you can dream of in terms of software.
				it has a more difficult learning curve, but is well rounded.
			</p>
			<a name="artix">Artix</a><p>
				A fork of <a href="#arch">Arch</a> without systemd, all the same good shit,
				minus the bloatware that is systemd. it has openrc, runit,
				and s6 versions, it also has releases with desktop enviroments preinstalled,
				which is covered below
			</p>
			<a name="gentoo">Gentoo</a><p>
				Another barebones and minimal linux distribution like Arch.
				it's designed around building as much of your software as possible
				from source, allowing for even more customization and efficency over distros like Arch,
				it also uses openrc as it's init system so you don't have to worry about systemd.
			</p>

		<section>
			<a name="9front" href="http://9front.org/"><b2>9Front</b2></a><p>
				A fork of <a href="#plan9">Plan9</a> with additional development including but not limited to more hardware
				support, nes/snes/gb/gbc/md emulators, the Constitution of the United States, The Manifesto of the Commmunist Party,
				and a whole lot more, just generally the updated version of Plan9, a lot of the dev's worked on the original aswell.
			</p>
			<a name="plan9">Plan9</a><p>
				A Utilitarian operating system from the same group who created Unix, in a lot of ways it is essentially
				Unix2, it focuses on simplicity and reusablity like original Unix but pushes it into a graphical era.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Linux Distributions with a Desktop Enviroment</h2>
			<a name="endeavos">EndeavorOS</a><p>
				EndeavorOS is a arch based linux distro with preinstalled desktop enviroments, xfce, lxqt,
				i3wm, etc, if you want arch but can't be bothered with installing the DE yourself this is for you.
			</p>
			<a name="artixgui">Artix</a><p>
				<a href="#artix">Artix</a> has isos for a variety of different desktop enviroments,
				you can think of this exactly like <a href="#endeavos">EndeavorOS</a> with a Artix base and slightly
				different defaults.
			</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Simple. Correct. Extensible. And Choice Driven</h2>
			<p>Write up on how i think operating systems should be designed, sort of tired of the current systems we have.</p>
			<p>Simple. a operating system should be simple, a low line count auditable codebase, but also low memory usage.</p>
			<p>Correct. do it right, or not at all, do not half ass implement bluetooth drivers to drive the userbase up.</p>
			<p>Portable. every part of the OS should be a tool that can be used in conjunction with others, portable to other systems and usable with other software ecosystems.</p>
			<p>Choice Driven. the operating system should be respectful of the users choice, and everything should be changible by an adept user.</p>

			<h2>Software that could be used for this</h2>
			<a>???</a><p>
				minix was one of the first microkernels and one of the inspirations for linux, ideally we'd have something more updated,
				but if this is our only choice it's not too bad.

				a secondary kernel option would be freebsd which has good driver support compared to minix.
			</p>

			<a href="https://www.musl-libc.org/">Musl</a><p>
				Provides a simple libc that can be statically linked, would probably have to be modified over its linux dependance
			</p>

			<a>Dash</a><p>
				really simple posix shell, a bit bloated on memory usage, busybox ash is better, hopefully toysh can be fixed up and replace it
			</p>

			<a>Toybox</a><p>
				Provides simple and efficient core utils, would probably be best to fork and add plan9 features as well as strip unneeded gnu features,
				maybe use sbase instead and port toybox things to it.
			</p>
			
			<a>Shell</a><p>
				the shell should be a mix of toysh, busybox ash, dash, oksh, and rc, keep the code as minimal as possible with the best scripting features and posix compliance.
			</p>

			<a>Doas</a><p>
				runs a program as another user, probably should be replaced by a program added in forked toybox.
			</p>

			<a>runit</a><p>
				super simple and fast init system. maybe use sinit to augment.
			</p>

			<a href="https://sr.ht/~mcf/cproc/">cproc</a><p>
				simple qbe frontend c compiler.
			</p>

			<a href="https://git.2f30.org/smdev/file/README.html">smdev</a><p>
				suckless mdev.
			</p>
			
			<a href="https://git.2f30.org/scron/file/README.html">scron</a><p>
				simple crond.
			</p>

			<a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a><p>
				openssl but less bad. maybe look at bearssl
			</p>

			<a href="http://smarden.org/socklog/">socklog</a><p>
				system and kernel logging services.
			</p>
			
			<a href="https://github.com/michaelforney/samurai">samurai</a><p>
				ninja compatible build system in pure c99.
			</p>

			<a href="https://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a><p>
				a really simple yet featured and featured package management system, supports both source and binary.
			</p>

			<a href="https://github.com/C-Chads/tinygl">Tiny-GL</a><p>
				software graphics library.
			</p>
			
			<a href="https://github.com/sabotage-linux/netbsd-curses">netbsd-curses</a><p>
				smaller than ncurses though software should start depending on things like termbox instead.
			</p>
			
			<a href="https://sortix.org/libz/">libz</a><p>
				zlib fork.
			</p>
